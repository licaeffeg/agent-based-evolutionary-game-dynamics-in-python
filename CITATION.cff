  NetLogo models for the book "Agent-Based Evolutionary Game
  Dynamics".


  This book is a guide to implement and analyze simple
  agent-based evolutionary models using NetLogo.


  All the models we implement are agent-based, i.e.
  individual agents and their interactions are explicitly
  represented in the models. To formalise agentsâ€™
  interactions we use the basic framework of Evolutionary
  Game Theory.


  NetLogo is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment
  used by hundreds of thousands of students, teachers and
  researchers all around the globe. No coding experience is
  necessary to fully understand the contents of this book.
